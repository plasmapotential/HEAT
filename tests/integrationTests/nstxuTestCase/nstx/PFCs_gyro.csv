#PFC CSV FILE
#
#This is a HEAT input file responsible for:
# 1) Defining the PFCs in the Region of Interest (ROI)
# 2) Defining the heat flux calculation mesh resolution for each PFC in ROI
# 3) Defining the intersection PFCs that the ROI PFCs could be shadowed by
# 4) Defining the timesteps we run HEAT for, w.r.t. each PFC
# 5) Defining which divertor each PFC is in
# 6) Defining any PFCs we want to exclude from the intersection calculation
#
#The first line in this file should always be:
#timesteps, PFCname, DivCode, intersectName, excludeName
#
#Each new row under this header line represents a new PFC in the ROI.
#Definitions of each column (comma separated variable) from this header line:
#  timesteps: timesteps we include the PFC in during the HEAT calculation
#  PFCname: the name of the CAD object as it appears in the CAD file.  If the 
#            user Brings Your Own Mesh (BYOM), then the PFC name should be the
#            name of the mesh (.stl) file.
#  resolution: heat flux resolution on PFCname.
#  DivCode:  divertor code.  This can be: LO, LI, UO, UI, which correspond to:
#            Lower Outer, Lower Inner, Upper Outer, Upper Inner.  These codes
#            are how each PFC in the ROI get flagged as belonging to a specific
#            divertor, and will affect their power later (Psol * powerFrac)
#  intersectName:  name of the PFCs that may cast a magnetic shadow upon the PFC
#                  we are calculating power on.  If we launch field lines from the
#                  PFCname part and follow them up the SOL, we may hit one of these
#                  intersectName PFCs.  If the user is unsure of this value, "all"
#                  can be specified to check against all parts in the CAD.
#                  Multiple PFCs can be specified by using ":" between part names.
#  excludeName:  name of PFCs to exclude in the intersection check.  This can be
#                useful when we use the "all" switch for intersectName and want
#                to exclude some obvious PFCs.
